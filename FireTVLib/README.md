Fire TV Lib ++
==========================

Notes: 

- You are mostly on your own using this library (as it is free).  However, I think the examples in the 'verify' folder should be fairly straight forward.
- This is for the standard Fire TV control.  I am working on a Fire TV 'Game Controller' library, but it may take some time as I'm kind of busy. :)

A. Test - This app was used to test for inputs from standard Fire TV input device.

B. Lib - A small library/module to map keys from the FireTV input.

C. Verify - This app was used to verify the resultant 'library' made from the 'test' results.
