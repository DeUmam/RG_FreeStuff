SSK
============
This is my 'Super Starter Kit' collection.  Since 2012, I have writing and accumulating a collection of useful scripts and assets.  These assets were designed to speed-up and simplify app development when using the Corona SDK.

Originally, this collection was monolithic pile of goodies.  In late 2013, I stopped maintaining that pile.  Now, some of the SSK contents are provided in bite-sized bits.

SSKCorona
============
This folder contains the original Graphics 1.0 and a partially converted Graphics 2.0 version of the monolithic SSK collection.

RG*
============
These folders contain the bite-sized portions of Graphics 2.0 compatible SSK stuff, including:
 * RGAndroidButtons - Drop in code to catch back button presses and pop-up a dialog: "Are you sure?" on Android devices.
 * RGEasyKeys - A drop in piece of code that converts key presses to events.  Also contains scrubbing code to make some OS X and Windows keys report the same event.
 * RGExtensions - Extensions to built-in classes: io, math, string, and table.  Also includes a portable random number generator and color transition code.
 * RGGlobals - A bunch of useful global variables and functions.
 * RGMath2D - A complete set of 2D math capable of operating on and producing discrete values and tables/objects.

4. It would be nice if everyone who uses SSK were to give me credit, but I understand that may not always be possible.  So, if you can please give a shout out like: "Made with SSK, by Roaming Gamer, LLC.", super, if not, darn...  Also, if you want to link back to my site that would be awesome too:   http://www.roaminggamer.com/
