CoronaTwine
============

This is a first pass parser/tool for converting twine source files into interactive fiction games via Corona SDK.

It requires a lot of work to make it cool, but has the most basic functions working, including passage parsing, choice creation, and passage navigation.

It utlizes a slightly modified version of MLText to produce the text and choice buttons.

It is lightly commented and requires some coding skill to understand.

Have fun!
